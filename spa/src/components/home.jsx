              Instead of focusing on content creation and hard work, we have
              learned how to master the art of doing nothing by providing
              massive amounts of whitespace and generic content that can seem
              massive, monolithic and worth your attention.

              Yes I know you probably disregarded the earlier boasts as
              non-sequitur filler content, but its really true. It took years of
              gene splicing and combinatory DNA research, but our bananas can
              really dance.
